    "On `/game`, connect UI to core game state: PlayerCard shows remaining and active highlight from currentPlayerIndex; Keypad has input + digit buttons + Enter + quick-score chips (26,41,45,60,85,100,121,140,180); Enter submits to applyTurn() and updates turn history; Undo triggers undoLastTurn(); history list shows last 5 turns.",

    "Add a lightweight checkout-suggestion module/table for common finishes <= 170 (1–3 suggestions), respecting Double Out (must finish on D or Bull when enabled)."

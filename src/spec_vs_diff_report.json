  "summary": "REQ-19 game-core updates appear largely implemented (game phases, awaiting-confirmation vs game-over behavior, winner/turns tracking, and bust handling). REQ-21 Game Over screen and rematch/new game actions are implemented. REQ-20 confirmation prompt is present, but the modal text/actions may not meet the “exact text”/YES-NO wording, and it’s not fully evidenced that score entry is blocked while awaiting confirmation due to truncation in GamePage.tsx.",

      "requirement": "When awaiting confirmation, the UI shows a prompt/modal containing exactly: \"Was it a double finish?\"",

      "reason": "Although Keypad gained a `disabled` prop, the provided/truncated GamePage diff does not show wiring that disables score entry/submission while `game.phase === 'awaiting-confirmation'` (render section is truncated).",
